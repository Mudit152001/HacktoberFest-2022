**The biggest open-source festival is back. Let's celebrate and learn. This repository has been made for beginners who are first time contributers in HacktoberFest.**<br/>
<br/>
**Hacktoberfest** is the celebration of Open-Source, its that time of the year when people from all over the world come together to contribute to their favorite Open Source projects. You can get more information about HacktoberFest [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
### What to contribute?
You can contribute programs based on algorithms in your favourite languages like `Java`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `C`, `C++` etc. You can also Contribute coding solutions from your favourite platforms like - `Hackerrank`, `LeetCode`, `HackerEarth`, `Codeforces` etc.


### Contributing Guide
* Star⭐ the repo
* Fork the repo
* Create a branch and name the branch as your GitHub username, example `chayan-chawra-1903`
* For programs, please add the programs in the folder specified for the language, name the file on the algorithm like - `BinarySearch.js`. Please refrain from posting the same algorithm multiple times in the same language.
* For coding solutions from different platforms please make a folder inside the platform folder and give the folder the same name as it is on the platform, and in side that folder make 2 files - `Problem Statement.md` `Solution.js` (*Solution can be in any language*)
example:
`Leetcode -> Build array from Permutation -> Problem Statement.md Solution.js`. Always follow this folder structure otherwise you PR will be discarded
* If you don't see your favourite programming language or your favourite platform, please create a new issue tagging the maintainers.
* While opening a PR please add proper description and also mention the files changed.
* **Readme changes will be discarded straightaway.**
* **Have patience after opening a PR, unnecessarily tagging the maintainers will lead to marking your PR as spam. If 2 PRs are marked as spam from one user, then they will be Blocked from further contribution to this repo.**

* In order to stop spam, we are limiting the above type of PRs to only **2 per contributor**.
* Once you have you have made 2 PRs of the above type, please post coding solutions from different platforms like `LeetCode`, `Hakerrank` etc. Please don't copy solutions. Post your own solutions.
* While opening a PR, please provide a proper title and a description of your PR. The description should contain the full file-path where the changes have been made. Additionally:
    * For a PR that consists of a code please also upload the screenshot of the output.
    * For a coding solution from a coding platform, upload the screenshot of the selected solution that has passed all the test cases. Also post the time complexity of your solution in the description of your PR.

**If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue and tag any of the 2 maintainers.**
